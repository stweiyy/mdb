my mini database

This small project is started for the reason of learning the backend principle 
of a relational database.

It mainly referenced the implementation of SQLite and MySQL, but it is much more
simple, even ugly.

But though this project, I think we can understand the database better, you can write
your own database software if you like.

Enjoy!
