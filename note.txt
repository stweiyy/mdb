This little project is started for learning the principle of the 
relational database. And it mainly referenced the implementation 
of SQLite and MySQL.

In order to make it as simple as possible, much of the code here 
ignored the stable requirement as a productive database. So it is 
some kind of ugly and full of bugs.

But the most important things is to learn the interal principle of
the database!

To Do list:
	1. finish the configuration module, use conf.ini.
	2. change and complete the leximal analysis and syntax analysis
	   lexer.cpp & parser.y
	3. implement the backend logic of the database.
	    create table ....
